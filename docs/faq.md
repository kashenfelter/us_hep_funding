In the US, HEP research is primarily funded by two scientific agencies, the **Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science**, and the **National Science Foundation's (NSF) Directorate for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences**. Government data on HEP grants and spending contracts is scattered across multiple websites and difficult to browse directly. On this page, I have collated federal HEP-related spending from the following three sources:

<br/>

### 1. Grants from the DOE Office of High Energy Physics
> HEP-specific work within the Office of Science

### 2. Contracts from the DOE Office of Science
> Data are not HEP-specific, but most Office of Science contracts are related to national laboratory spending, which is critical to HEP research.

### 3. Grants from the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences 
> Again, not HEP-specific, but relevant to Congressional advocacy, since Congress does not have budgetary authority below the Directorate level.

<br/>
One caveat in using this data, in addition to those listed above, is to watch for the effect of re-districting in moving universities (and businesses) across Congressional district boundary lines. Since I include data going back to 2012, institutions may be listed in multiple congressional districts if they changed district during this time. 

<br/>
Additionally, though you may see negative numbers in certain years for some grants/contracts, these are (to the best of my knowledge) accounting adjustments to prior federal funding.

If you encounter any other issues using the website, feel free to write an issue on the project's [GitHub page](https://github.com/mbaumer/us_hep_funding/issues).
