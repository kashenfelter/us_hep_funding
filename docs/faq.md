In the US, HEP research is primarily funded by two scientific agencies, the **Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Science**, and the **National Science Foundation's (NSF) Directorate for the Mathematical and Physical Sciences**. Government data on HEP grants and spending contracts is scattered across multiple websites and difficult to browse directly. On this page, I have collated federal HEP-related spending from the following three sources:

<br/>

### 1. Grants from the DOE Office of High Energy Physics
> HEP-specific work within the Office of Science. Source: [DOE Office of Science](https://science.energy.gov/universities/sc-in-your-state/)

### 2. Contracts from the DOE Office of Science
> Data are not HEP-specific, but most Office of Science contracts are related to national laboratory spending, which is critical to HEP research. Source: (http://usaspending.gov)

### 3. Grants from the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences 
> Again, not HEP-specific, but relevant to Congressional advocacy, since Congress does not have budgetary authority below the Directorate level. Source: (http://usaspending.gov)

## Caveats

**Data.** Raw datasets published by government agencies can be--/ahem/--tricky to work with. There's missing data, inconsistent entries, and broad categories that can obscure trends of interest in the data. For example, DOE Office of Science contracts don't specify which sub-office funded them, making it impossible to display only DOE contracts from the Office of High Energy Physics

**Accounting.** There's an accounting distinction on federal projects (so I learned) between the location of the "recipient" of a grant/contract, and the location where the work is actually performed. I have tried to consistently use the /place of performance/, but the result leads to some confusing entries, with university grants, for example, being assigned to multiple Congressional districts. These are either mistakes by the agencies recording the locations, or universities obtaining grants for research at offsite locations. The effect of re-districting/district re-numbering can also move universities and businesses across Congressional district boundary lines over time. Since I include data going back to 2012, institutions may be listed in multiple congressional districts if they changed district during this time. 
Additonally, you may see negative numbers in certain years for some grants/contracts; these are (to the best of my knowledge) accounting adjustments to prior federal funding.
